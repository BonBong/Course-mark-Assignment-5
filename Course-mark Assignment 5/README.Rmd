##Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r quick_look, echo = TRUE}

```{r xy_plot, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center", fig.path = "./figures.", dev = "svg"}

data("anscombe")
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
anscombe.nu <- select(anscombe, x1, y1)
anscombe.nu
plot(anscombe.nu$y1~anscombe.nu$x1,
     main = "Anscombe Scatterplot",
     xlab = "x1",
     ylab = "y1",
     ylim = c(3,12),
     xlim = c(3, 15),
     pch = 24)

```{r data_import, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
df <- read.csv("analgesic.csv")
```

```{r data_summary, echo = TRUE}
dim(df)
colnames(df)
head(df)
tail(df)
summary(df)
```

```{r data_tidy, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
# Tidy the data from a wide to long format 
df.new <- gather(df, Replicate_reading, Measurement, Measurement_1:Measurement_3) 

# Group by the 'Group' column ("Analgesic", "Placebo")
grouped <- group_by(df.new, Group) 
grouped

# Group by the 'ID' column
grouped.2 <- group_by(grouped, ID)  
grouped.2

# Get the mean for every individual's ("ID") measurements
sum <- summarize(grouped.2, mean(Measurement)) 

# Print the final dataframe
sum
```

#CHICKEN WEIGHTS

##Null Hypothesis
* No relationship exists between type of feed supplement and chick weight.

##Alternative Hypothesis
* The feed supplement most resemblant of the wild type nutrient will promote the highest weight gain in the chicks.
```{r chicken_weights, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center", fig.path = "./figures.", dev = "svg"}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# import dataset
chkwt <- read.csv("chkwts.csv")
chkwts <- tbl_df(chkwt)
chkwts

# Explore data with plots
qplot(x = feed,
      y = weight,
      data = chkwts,
      geom = "boxplot",
      xlab = "Feed",
      ylab = "Weight (g)",
      main = "Neonate chicks' weight per feed supplement type")

# Statistical Test (ANOVA)
ANO.VA <- aov(weight~feed, data = chkwts)
summary(ANO.VA)

# Correct for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc test
pairwise.t.test(chkwts$weight, chkwts$feed,
                p.adjust.method = 'bonferroni',
                paired = FALSE)
```

##Test Assumptions
* Gaussian distribution
* Equal variance amongst groups
* Independent errors
* Data are unmatched

##Outcome Analysis
* Casein promotes the most growth out of all the feed supplements, while horsebean promotes the least. There is no statistical difference between the  casein, meat meal, and sunflower supplements, suggesting that the latter two are as statistically efficient in promoting growth. However, this does not signify biological efficiency. 
* Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis

#THE HOT ZONE

##Null Hypothesis 
* There is no relationship beween consumption of contaminated water and presentation with gastroenteritis. 

##Alternative Hypothesis 
* Consumption of contaminated water causes gastroenteritis. 

```{r the_hot_zone, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center", fig.path = "./figures.", dev = "svg"}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# import dataset
gastroe <- read.csv("hotzone.csv")
gastro <- tbl_df(gastroe)
head(gastro)
tail(gastro)
# Cross tabulate with xtabs
gastroX <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome,
      data = gastro)
gastroX

# plot gastroX
barplot(gastroX, beside = TRUE,
        main = "Relationship between gastroenteritis presentation and the amount of consumed contaminated water by people in a small town",
        xlab = "Presentation",
        ylab = "Number of People",
        col = c("black", "red", "grey"))

par(xpd = TRUE)
legend("topright", c("< 1 glass/day", "< 4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), bty = "n", fill = c("black", "red", "grey"))

# Statistics (Pearson's Chi-squared Test)
 ChiSq <- chisq.test(gastroX, correct = FALSE)
 ChiSq
```
##Statistical Test
* Pearson's Chi-square test
* X-squared = 74.925, degrees of freedom = 2, p value < 2.2e-16

### Test Assumptions:
* random sampling
* independent observations
* large sample size
* discrete probability in observed frequencies within the table can be estimated by the continuous X^2^ distribution

##Outcome Analysis
* The p value indicates a significant relationship between the amount of contaminated water consumed and whether or not a given individual presented with gastroenteritis. Namely, the amount of contaminated water consumed was directly proportional to gastroenteritis incidences.
* Therefore, reject the null hypothesis.

#NAUSEA

##Null Hypothesis
* Administration of 5HT3 receptor antagonist does not ameliorate nausea intensity. 

##Alternative Hypothesis
* Administration of 5HT3 receptor antagonist decreases nausea intensity. 

```{r Nausea, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center", fig.path = "./figures.", dev = "svg"}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# import dataset
nnausea <- read.csv("nausea.csv")
nausea <- tbl_df(nnausea)
nausea

# On the assumption that the value '40' in the "Nausea after", column is incorrect, I've assumed it is really '4'.Therefore I've changed it.
nausea[8,3] =4
nausea

# Removing the "Patient Coluumn" for the purposes of plotting with base graphics
nausea.regr <- select(nausea, Nausea_before, Nausea_after, -Patient)
nausea.regr

plot(nausea$Nausea_before~nause
```

## Statistical Test
* Paired T test
* t = 3.3072, degrees of freedom = 7, p value = 0.01299

###Test Assumptions:
* Gaussian distribution 
* equal variance amongst groups 
* independent errors
* effective data matching 

#Outcome Analysis
